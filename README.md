# HW3_Password_Generator

It's a password generator. You use it to generate a password.
That's why it says "password generator" on the box.

Press the start button. Provide four different inputs,
one of which is a string, three of which are binary choices.

You then get a password. From the Password generator. Because it generated a password.
That's what password generators do.

Generate.

Password.
